Description: Collecting and analysing data from four-arm olfactometer experiments can be frustrating as 
    the tools currently available are either prohibitively expensive or outdated. olfactometeR provides a 
    set of tools to help make recording olfactometry experiments easier, quicker and cheaper. See the GitHub repo for 
    more detailed information and examples.
