# olfactometeR - Streamlined data acquisition and analysis for olfactometer experiments

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The olfactometeR package provides various features that optimise olfactometer experiments from data acquisition to visualisation and analysis. This package was largely written for personal use, but as the currently available software programmes for olfactometer experiments are either expensive or outdated and without an existing R package it has made publically available.   

*DISCLAIMER: olfactometeR is currently under active development and not all features are optimised or available at present.*

## Installation

You can install the development version of olfactometeR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Dr-Joe-Roberts/olfactometeR")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(olfactometeR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
