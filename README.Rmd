`olfactometeR` provides easy to use functions to facilitate data collection for experiments using olfactometers to study the behavioural responses of test subjects to volatile chemical stimuli under laboratory conditions. This package was largely written for undergraduate students and entomology researchers in the [Bruce Lab at Keele University](https://www.keele.ac.uk/lifesci/ourpeople/tobybruce/#research-and-scholarship) to replace outdated software programmes that do not run on modern operating systems. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of olfactometeR from [GitHub](https://github.com/): 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Dr-Joe-Roberts/olfactometeR")
```


## Using `olfactometeR`

> Until the non-development version of `olfactometeR` is released please be aware that changes made here are likely to be sporadic but drastic. Use at your own discression! 

Currently `olfactometeR` has four functions that can be split into two categories:

1. Data collection 
2. Data processing

Data collection functions allow the user to interact with the R console to record the behavioural response of their study subject in four-arm or Y-tube olfactometer experiments:

* `record_four_arm()`: collect data from four-arm olfactometers 
* `record_y_tube()`: collect data from Y-tube olfactometers

Data processing functions allow the user to combine multiple replicates from the same experiment into a single output for data analysis and/or visualisation:

* `summarise_four_arm()`
* `summarise_y_tube()`


## Examples

##### 1. Four Arm Olfactometer

Executing the `record_four_arm()` function will first prompt the user to enter a variety of experimental details that are required to ensure accurate data collection and traceability. Both the 'study species being tested' and 'treatment' details need to be entered between quotation marks (e.g. `Treatment: "Linalool (0.1 mg/ml)"`). A summary table of the experimental details will be displayed in the console to allow the user to corroborate them prior to data collection.   

Four-arm olfactometers are conventionally split into five zones, one for each arm as well as a central zone, with each zone corresponding to a numerical key from 1 to 5. When the study subject leaves a zone, the user must press the numerical key assigned to the departed zone then `Enter` for the time spent in the zone to be recorded. Once the observation period is complete, the user can end data collection by pressing `t` then `Enter`, which will display a summary results table for the observation period in the console and prompt the user to save the output as a .xlsx file. `record_four_arm()` can accomodate up to two treatment arms.

##### 2. Y-Tube Olfactometer

Executing the `record_y_tube()` function will first prompt the user to enter a variety of experimental details that are required to ensure accurate data collection and traceability. Both the 'study species being tested' and 'treatment' details need to be entered between quotation marks (e.g. `Treatment: "Linalool (0.1 mg/ml)"`). A summary table of the experimental details will be displayed in the console to allow the user to corroborate them prior to data collection. 

Each of the two Y-tube olfactometer arm corresponds to a numerical key, either 1 or 2. When the study subject enters one of the olfactometer arms and crosses the pre-determined line to indicate a decision has been made, the user must press the numerical key assigned to the entered olfactometer arm then `Enter` to record the individual as having made a choice. Recording will automatically end once a choice has been entered into the console, displaying a summary results table in the console.

```
library(olfactometeR)

## The future :crystal_ball:

There are a number of features I intend to develop for `olfactometeR` to help streamline data analysis and visualisation for behavioural experiments using olfactometry. Feature suggestions and issue reports welcome!
